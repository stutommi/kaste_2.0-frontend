This is a project that aims to update my first plant-watering app called kaste. It is a collaboration with my brother. My brother takes care of sensordata and watering mechanics, and makes it accessible through an API. My job is to store that data to database and provide information and interactivity to be accessed by the user from the UI.

The aim of the app is to provide information on house plants and enable remote-watering.
this repository includes the UI the users will interact with. It is to be built as a web app using React and might expand to mobile version also featuring react-native.

I've learned alot after making the first version, and I feel like every part of the app can be improved (in regards of code quality, strategy and performance). Last version used class-components, this is going to be implemented with hooks. It's also going to be deployed in heroku (last version was running on Raspberry pi).
Like last one, this is bootstrapped with create-react-app.

My repo of earlier version of react is found from github at:
